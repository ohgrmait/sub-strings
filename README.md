  Hash Listing Frequency of Each Sub String
</div>

## About
`sub-strings` is a classic "intro to programming problem" wherein the method `substrings(string, substrings)` takes a word and an array of valid substrings (dictionary) and returns a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string (along with their frequencies).[^1]

## Self Reflections
- > I ended up choosing the [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails) path. As a result, I've started with the [Ruby Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) and learned quite a lot of things like basic data types, variables, input and output, conditional logic, loops, arrays, hashes, methods, debugging, basic and predicate enumerable methods, and nested collections.
